Henlo. Welcome to the BorrowedChords manifesto.

BorrowedChords is a music theory utility for songwriters.

BorrowedChords allows a user to select a key then shows a
table of available chords which can be substituted for the chords
based on the home key.

The app generates results on demand by processing the intervals
between notes in scales and chords.

Future functionality may include support for available 7ths and 
tension notes as well as a note taking function to allow users to
plan their chord progressions. I'd also like to add a suggestion
utility to provide hints about chord progressions which follow 
note resolution concepts or outline chord choices which purposefully
oppose note resolution concepts ( allisions / idiomatic expression / retrogression ).
